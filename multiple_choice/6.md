# Why is having single timeseries a problem?
1. Proper timeseries analysis is not typically taught in university courses
1. Quantities of interest are defined on the state space
1. Same timeseries could be output of several different systems
1. One dimensional dynamical systems cannot be chaotic

# Why is choosing too large τ a problem?
1. τ must be smaller than the sampling time
1. The amount of reconstructed points is bounded by N - τ and higher τ reduce available points
1. Large τ leads to overfolding due to existing chaotic dynamics
1. Large τ leads to sensitive dependence on initial condition taking place

# How should the curve $E_d$ vs $d$ behave?
1. It starts near 1 and saturates to 0
1. It starts near 0 and saturates to 1
1. It starts near 1 and decreases linearly forever
1. It starts near 0 and increases linearly forever

# How does $\xi_n$ behave versus $n$ if the original timeseries was chaotic?
1. It increases exponentially without saturation.
1. It increases linearly without saturation.
1. It increases exponentially with saturation.
1. It increases linearly with saturation.
