# In a transcritical bifurcation
* Two fixed points meet and annihilate
* Two fixed points meet and exchange stability properties
* One fixed point becomes two stable-unstable points
* A stable fixed point becomes unstable and two stable points are born

# The existence of two branches in an orbit diagram indicates
* Two stable fixed points (coexisting attractors)
* Periodic motion of period 1
* Periodic motion of period 2
* One stable and one unstable fixed points

# A continuously filled vertical slice in an orbit diagram indicates
* Periodic motion
* Chaotic motion
* Quasiperiodic motion
* Chaotic or quasiperiodic motion (can't know without context)

# The existence of a single branch in an orbit diagram of a continuous system indicates
* Stable fixed point
* Periodic motion
* Quasiperiodic motion
* Chaotic motion

# What is the core process that leads to intermittency?
* Unstable fixed points that used to be stable
* An (approximately) regular structure that traps the trajectory
* Interplay of stable and unstable limit cycles
* Stochastic noise added on top of periodic motion
