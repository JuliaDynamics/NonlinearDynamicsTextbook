# What defines nonlinear systems?
1. Systems that depend on both space and time (spatiotemporal)
1. Systems that have several interacting parts
1. Systems that do not satisfy the superposition principle
1. Systems with more than two degrees of freedom

# Discrete systems satisfy trajectory uniqueness when
1. $$f$$ is continuous
1. $$f$$ is continuous and differentiable
1. Uniqueness can never be guaranteed
1. Uniqueness is always guaranteed

# Fixed points satisfy
1. $$\dot{x} = x$$ for continuous and $$x_{n+1} = x_n$$ for discrete
1. $$\dot{x} = 0$$ for continuous and $$x_{n+1} = x_n$$ for discrete
1. $$\dot{x} = x$$ for continuous and $$x_{n+1} = 0$$ for discrete
1. $$\dot{x} = 0$$ for continuous and $$x_{n+1} = 0$$ for discrete

# The linearized dynamics of a discrete dynamical system at point $$x$$ are overall contracting if
1. $$|\text{det}(J_f)(x)| = \left|\prod_i \mu_i\right| < 1$$
1. $$\left| \text{det}(J_f)(x)\right| =  \left| \prod_i \mu_i\right| = 0$$
1. $$|\text{trace}(J_f)(x)| = \left|\sum_i \mu_i \right| < 1$$
1. $$\text{trace}(J_f)(x) = \sum_i \mu_i = 0$$
