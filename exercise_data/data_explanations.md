1 = Mackie Glass chaotic timeseries
2 = Roessler chaotic trajectory (1st parameter set)
3 = Lorenz chaotic trajectory (1st parameter set, dense time sampling)
4 = Roessler chaotic trajectory, low sampling, 2nd parameter set
5 = collection of periodic and quasiperiodic timeseries, most of which are contaminated by noise, and one of which is chaotic (for misdirection)
6 = towel map chaotic trajectory
7 = Non-stationary dynamics of logistic map
8 = oscillatory ARMA, embedded in 4d
9 = 6dimensional Lorenz96 with 2% AR noise - Periodic or Quasiperiodic (don't know!)
10 = 5dimensional Lorenz96 with 2% AR noise - Chaotic trajectory
11 = Hemispherically averaged, monthly averaged, de-seasonalized, reflected shortwave radiation, obtained from CERES data: https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/
12 = Experimental timeseries of chaotic electrochemical oscillations from Ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07040
13 = Same as 12 but slightly different experimental conditions
14 = Dataset 93 of https://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/cause-effect/ (citation = J. M. Mooij, J. Peters, D. Janzing, J. Zscheischler, B. Schoelkopf: "Distinguishing cause from effect using observational data: methods and benchmarks"). First column of data is average precipitation over 1948 to 2004 in mm/day, second is average runoff
15 = Same as 14, but dataset 73: first column is CO2 emissions, second column is energy use (kg of oil equivalent)
16 = Long-time simulation data for orbital parameters of Earth, from http://vo.imcce.fr/insola/earth/online/earth/online/index.php with DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361:20041335. The data (each column) are: time (1000yr), eccentricity, climatic precession, obliquity (radians), insolation (W/m^2). Latitude is 65, record at day of summer solstice (21 June, true longitude = 90).
17 = Vostok Ice Core Data for 420,000 Years. First column is time in years (increasing towards the past), second column is estimated temperature difference w.r.t. current day temperature. Notice that the data are not equi-temporally sampled. The data were downloaded from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/ with suggested data citation: "Petit, J.R., et al., 2001, Vostok Ice Core Data for 420,000 Years, IGBP PAGES/World Data Center for Paleoclimatology Data Contribution Series #2001-076. NOAA/NGDC Paleoclimatology Program, Boulder CO, USA." and see https://doi.org/10.1038/20859
18 = EEG recordings of a patient from the Siena Scalp EEG Database. Each Column is one EEG signal at electrode F8 (right frontal region, patient has right-hemisphere seizures) from patient 0, downsampled to 64Hz. The seizures in the recordings are documented to have started at t=[1143.0s, 1220.0s, 1006.0s, 904.0s] and ended at t=[1213.0s, 1274.0s, 1080.0s, 971.0s], respectively. These times correspond to the indices [585216, 624640, 515072, 462848] for the start times and [621056, 652288, 552960, 497152] for the end times. These time series were downloaded from https://physionet.org/files/siena-scalp-eeg/1.0.0/PN00/PN00-1.edf and converted into the csv format using convert_18.py
